        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These cranberry orange cookies are nice to have during the holidays, but <em>don't expect them to stay around long</em>. These orange-flavored cranberry cookies are <strong>tart</strong> and <strong>delicious</strong>, not to mention beautiful. Not really a favorite of kids.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong>: These sweet cookies start with two sticks of softened butter.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugars</strong>: You'll need white and brown sugars for the cookie dough, while confectioners' sugar goes into the glaze.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg adds moisture and richness. It also acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Orange</strong>: This flavorful cookie recipe calls for orange juice (fresh or store-bought) and orange zest â€” in the dough and the glaze.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour adds structure and brings the dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Cranberries</strong>: Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free.</li>
            <li>Walnuts: Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the egg, juice, and zest.</li>
            <li>Whisk the dry ingredients in another bowl, then add the dry mixture to the wet mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cranberries and nuts.</li>
